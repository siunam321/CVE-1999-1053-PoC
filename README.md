## Proof-of-Concept Exploit

### Description

> The Matt Wright `guestbook.pl` <= v2.3.1 CGI script contains a flaw that may allow arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability requires that HTML posting is enabled in the `guestbook.pl` script, and that the web server must have the Server-Side Include (SSI) script handler enabled for the '`.html`' file type. By combining the script weakness with non-default server configuration, it is possible to exploit this vulnerability successfully. (From [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9907))
